# Getting Started
So you want to join the official SecondCraft Minecraft Server? Great!  
Here's a few things you need to take care of to get going.  
  
Don't worry, you'll only have to do this once ;)

## Checklist

Before we begin setting you up, let's make sure we're not wasting your time.  
  
Are you whitelisted already? If not, [click here](https://discord.gg/fz7NkNYYUE){target="_blank"} to join our Discord.   
Then go to the [#whitelist](https://discord.com/channels/1138524746326212669/1141104418977234984){target="_blank"} channel and add your Minecraft username.

### Requirements
Does your computer meet the minimum requirements for running modded Minecraft?

You need a PC with:

- RAM: 8 GB or more
- CPU: > 3 GHz
- GPU: yes

If you need help checking these requirements, [go here](specifications.md).  
Should your PC not meet these requirements, you can still proceed, however the game will most likely not be very performant, and might lag a lot.
