# Memory Advisor

Here is a small recommendation table that shows you how much RAM you can allocate to Java depending on your available system memory:

| System Memory (Total RAM) | Recommended RAM | Max RAM (possibly unsafe) |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 8 GB                      | 5120 MB         | 6144 MB                   |
| 16 GB                     | 8192 MB         | 10240 MB                  |
| > 16 GB                   | 8192 MB         | -                         |


Most modpacks recommend at least between 5 GB (5120 MB) and 6 GB (6144 MB).
You might have a smoother experience if you assign more RAM, however, don't go overboard with this.

!!! danger "Don't assign too much Memory!"
    The RAM you give to Minecraft you take away from the rest of your applications (browser, discord, etc.), which might lead to system instability, unresponsive applications and crashes.  
    Leave some memory available for the rest of your system.

Additionally, you can immagine memory for Java or Minecraft as the house it lives in. If you move it into a bigger house, it sure has a lot more room to work with, but it also takes way longer to clean the house!

!!! info "Shaders and Resource Packs"
    However, you can (and should) assign a little bit more RAM if you plan to play with Resource / Texture Packs and / or Shaders.
